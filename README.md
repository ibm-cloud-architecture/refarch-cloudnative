# Digital Applications using a Microservice Architecture

## Architecture

This project provides is a Reference Implementation for building an OmniChannel Application using a microservices architecture.  The Logical Architecture for this reference implementation is shown in the picture below.  

   ![Application Architecture](static/imgs/app_architecture.png?raw=true)

## Application Overview

The application is a simple Shopping Application that displays a List of Inventory as well as a Social Review.  Both the Mobile App and Web App rely on separate Microservices to retrieve the Inventory data along with the review.  

There are several components of this architecture.  

- This OmniChannel application contains both a [Native iOS Application](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/) and an [angular](https://angularjs.org/) based web application.  The diagram depicts them as a Device and Browser.  
- The iOS application uses the [IBM Mobile Analytics Service](https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/mobile-analytics/) to collect device analytics for operations and business
- Both Client Applications make API calls through an API Gateway.  The API Gateway is [API Connect](https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/api-connect/).  API Connect provides an OAuth Provider as well, allowing you to implement API Security.  
- The API's are implemented as Node JS Microservices, we call BFFs following the [Backend for Frontends](http://samnewman.io/patterns/architectural/bff/) pattern.  In this Layer, front end developers usually write backend logic for their front end.  The Inventory BFF is implemented using the Express Framework.  The Social Review BFF is implemented using [API Connect's loopback framework](https://docs.strongloop.com/display/APIC/Using+LoopBack+with+IBM+API+Connect).  These Microservices run in Bluemix as Cloud Foundry Applications.  
- The Node JS BFFs invoke another layer of reusable Java Microservices.  In a real world project, this is sometimes written by a different team.  These reusable microservices are written in Java using [SpringBoot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/).  They run inside [IBM Containers](https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/images) using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).  
- Node BFF's and Java Microservices communicate to each other using the [Netflix OSS Framework](https://netflix.github.io/).  In this case, we run several Netflix components in Bluemix.
    - [Zuul](https://github.com/Netflix/zuul) provides a proxy layer for the microservices.  
    - [Eureka](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka) provides a Service Registry.  The reusable Java Microservices register themselves to Eureka which allows clients to find them.
    - [Hystrix](https://github.com/Netflix/hystrix) Provides an implementation of the [Circuit Breaker Pattern](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html).  This component runs as library inside the Java Applications.  This component them forward Service Availability information to the Hystrix Dashboard.  
- The Java Microservices retrieve their data from databases.  The Inventory Application using [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/).  In this example, we run MySQL in a Docker Container for Development (In a production environment, it runs on our Infrastructure as a Service layer, [Softlayer](http://www.softlayer.com))  The resiliency and DevOps section will explain that.  The SocialReview Java Microservice relies on [Cloudant](https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/cloudant-nosql-db/) as its Database.

1. Log in to [the Bluemix console](https://console.ng.bluemix.net)
2. From the Bluemix menu, Select Services -> APIs, then click the **API Connect** tile in the page.
3. In API Connect creation page, specify the Service name anything you like or keep the default. Then select the free **Essentials** plan for this walkthrough. Click the "Create" button to provision the service.  
4. After the API Connect service is created, you will be automatically redirected to API Management console.  
5. In the API Manager page, navigate to the API Connect Dashboard and select "Add Catalog" at the top left. You may notice that a sandbox has automatically been generated for you.  
![API Info](static/imgs/apic_catalog_create.png?raw=true)
6. Name the catalog "**BlueCompute**" and press "Add".
7. Select the catalog and then navigate to the Settings tab and click the Portal sub-tab.
8. To setup a Developer Portal that your consumers can use to explore your API, select the IBM Developer Portal radio button. Then click the "Save" button to top right menu section. This will provision a portal for you. You should receive a message like the one below. ![API Info](static/imgs/bluemix_9.png?raw=true)
9. Once the new Developer Portal has been created, you will receive an email.


#### Installing the IBM API Connect Developer Toolkit

The IBM API Connect Developer Toolkit provides both the API Designer UI and a CLI that developers can use to develop APIs and LoopBack applications, as welll as the tools to publish them to the IBM API Connect runtime.

Before getting started, you will need to install Node.js version 0.12 or version 4.x, follow the link below for more information details. [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFS6T/com.ibm.apic.toolkit.doc/tapim_cli_install.html](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFS6T/com.ibm.apic.toolkit.doc/tapim_cli_install.html)

To install the APIC Connect CLI:

```
$ npm install -g apiconnect
$ apic -version
```

That should install the tool and print the version number after the last command.



### Step 6: Deploy Inventory BFF Node.js application to Bluemix Cloud Foundry

This bff application will proxy (through Zuul) to the inventory microservice. It also exposes services to IBM API Connect for the Mobile and Web application to consume.

Please follow the instruction in [refarch-cloudnative-bff-inventory](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-bff-inventory) repository to build/deploy the Inventory Node.js application to Bluemix Cloud Foundry runtime.
